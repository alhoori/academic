abstract: The ever-growing number of venues publishing academic work makes it difficult
  for researchers to identify venues that publish data and research most in line with
  their scholarly interests. A solution is needed, therefore, whereby researchers
  can identify information dissemination pathways in order to both access and contribute
  to an existing body of knowledge. In this study, we present a system to recommend
  scholarly venues rated in terms of relevance to a given researcher’s current scholarly
  pursuits and interests. We collected our data from an academic social network and
  modeled researchers’ scholarly reading behavior in order to propose a new and adaptive
  implicit rating technique for venues. We present a way to recommend relevant, specialized
  scholarly venues using these implicit ratings that can provide quick results, even
  for new researchers without a publication history and for emerging scholarly venues
  that do not yet have an impact factor. We performed a large-scale experiment with
  real data to evaluate the current scholarly recommendation system and showed that
  our proposed system achieves better results than the baseline. The results provide
  important up-to-the-minute signals that compared with post-publication usage-based
  metrics represent a closer reflection of a researcher’s interests.
