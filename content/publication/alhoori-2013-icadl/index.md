abstract: Qatar has become an active research producer of data, publications, and
  other scholarly works. We studied the evolving scholarly activities and needs of
  researchers in this relatively new research environment, and compared them with
  previous findings from a well-established environment in the United States. The
  initial findings shed some light on the similarities and differences in information
  seeking behavior and information needs. We also highlighted some requirements and
  solutions appropriate for future international digital libraries and social reference
  management systems.
