abstract: New scholarly venues (e.g., conferences and journals) are emerging as research
  fields expand. Ranking these new venues is imperative to assist researchers, librarians,
  and research institutions. However, rankings based on traditional citation-based
  metrics have limitations and are no longer the only or the best choice to determine
  the impact of scholarly venues. Here, we propose a venue-ranking approach based
  on scholarly references from academic social media sites, and we compare a number
  of citation-based rankings with social-based rankings. Our preliminary results show
  a statistically significant correlation between the two approaches in a number of
  general rankings, research areas, and subdisciplines. Furthermore, we found that
  social-based rankings favor open-access venues over venues that require a subscription.
