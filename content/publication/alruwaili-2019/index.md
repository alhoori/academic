abstract: 'Twitter is a popular platform for e-commerce in the Arab region including
  the sale of illegal goods and services. Social media platforms present multiple
  opportunities to mine information about behaviors pertaining to both illicit and
  pharmaceutical drugs and likewise to legal prescription drugs sold without a prescription,
  i.e., illegally. Recognized as a public health risk, the sale and use of illegal
  drugs, counterfeit versions of legal drugs, and legal drugs sold without a prescription
  constitute a widespread problem that is reflected in and facilitated by social media.
  Twitter provides a crucial resource for monitoring legal and illegal drug sales
  in order to support the larger goal of finding ways to protect patient safety. We
  collected our dataset using Arabic keywords. We then categorized the data using
  four machine learning classifiers. Based on a comparison of the respective results,
  we assessed the accuracy of each classifier in predicting two important considerations
  in analysing the extent to which drugs are available on social media: references
  to drugs for sale and the legality/illegality of the drugs thus advertised. For
  predicting tweets selling drugs, Support Vector Machine, yielded the highest accuracy
  rate (96%), whereas for predicting the legality of the advertised drugs, the Naive
  Bayes, classifier yielded the highest accuracy rate (85%).'
