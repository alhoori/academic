abstract: A new and diverse set of online metrics are emerging to capture the effects
  of the sharing and discussion of research articles on online platforms. In this
  paper, we investigate whether altmetrics differ between Open Access (OA) and Non-Open
  Access (NOA) articles. We define a new metric, the Open Access Altmetric Advantage,
  and investigate 14 online data sources (Twitter, Facebook, CiteULike, Mendeley,
  F1000, blogs, mainstream news outlets, Google Plus, Pinterest, Reddit, Sina Weibo,
  the peer review sites PubPeer and Publons, policy documents, and sites running Stack
  Exchange (Q&A)). In eight of the data sources investigated, we found that OA articles
  receive higher altmetrics than NOA articles; however, we found less significant
  differences when taking into consideration some influential factors such as journal,
  publication year, and citation count.
