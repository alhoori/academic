abstract: In this study we performed an initial investigation and evaluation of altmetrics
  and their relationship with public policy citation of research papers. We examined
  methods for using altmetrics and other data to predict whether a research paper
  is cited in public policy and applied receiver operating characteristic curve on
  various feature groups in order to evaluate their potential usefulness. From the
  methods we tested, classifying based on tweet count provided the best results, achieving
  an area under the ROC curve of 0.91.
