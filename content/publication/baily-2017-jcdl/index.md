abstract: "In this study we performed an initial investigation and evaluation of altmetrics and their relationship with public policy citation of research papers. We examined methods for using altmetrics and other data to predict whether a research paper is cited in public policy and applied receiver operating characteristic curve on various feature groups in order to evaluate their potential usefulness. From the methods we tested, classifying based on tweet count provided the best results, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.91."
