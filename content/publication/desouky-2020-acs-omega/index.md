abstract: Acid-fracturing operations are mainly applied in tight carbonate formations
  to create a highly conductive path. Estimating the conductivity of a hydraulic fracture
  is essential for predicting the fractured well productivity. Several models were
  developed previously to estimate the conductivity of acid-fractured rocks. In this
  research, machine learning methods were applied to 560 acid fracture experimental
  datapoints to develop several conductivity correlations that honor the rock types
  and etching patterns. Developing one universal correlation often results in significant
  error. To develop conductivity correlations, various data preprocessing methods
  were applied to remove the outliers and failed experiments. Features that did not
  contribute to precise predictions were removed through regularization. A machine
  learning classifier was built to predict the etching pattern based on the input
  data. We generated a multivariate linear regression model and compared it with other
  models generated through ridge regression. In addition to that, artificial neural
  network-based model was proposed to predict the fracture conductivity of several
  carbonate rocks such as dolomite, chalk, and limestone. The performance of the developed
  models was assessed using well-known metrics such as precision, accuracy, mean squared
  error, recall, and correlation coefficients. Cross-validation was also employed
  to assure accuracy and avoid overfitting. The classifier accuracy was 93%, while
  the regression model resulted in a relatively high correlation coefficient.
