abstract: ' This article presents the first phase of an exciting initiative in the
  Arabian Gulf State of Qatar that brings together four academic institutions working
  to develop a digital library infrastructure of people, services, software, hardware,
  and content related to Qatar. Building on prior work on curricular resources developed
  for the digital library field and extending them to support Arabic as well as English
  instruction, educators, librarians, and IT specialists are working with content
  experts, stakeholders, students, and researchers to identify and preserve Qatar
  oriented digital library collections and information systems.'
