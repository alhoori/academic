abstract: Scientific publications and other genres of research output are increasingly
  being cited in policy documents. Citations in documents of this nature could be
  considered a critical indicator of the significance and societal impact of the research
  output. In this study, we built classification models that predict whether a particular
  research work is likely to be cited in a public policy document based on the attention
  it received online, primarily on social media platforms. We evaluated the classifiers
  based on their accuracy, precision, and recall values. We found that Random Forest
  and Multinomial Naive Bayes classifiers performed better overall.
