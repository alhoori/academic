abstract: Given its ascendancy as a way to make connections worldwide, social media
  is affecting all areas of people’s lives. This paper focuses on analyzing how Twitter
  bots interact with scholarly articles. The growing number and increasing complexity
  of Twitter bots make it hard to identify who is actually tweeting about scholarly
  articles. The purpose of this paper is to provide metrics to determine—based on
  an analysis of the relationship between Twitter bots and several research factors—whether
  or not a given scholarly paper has been disseminated via a bot. We developed and
  tested several supervised machine learning classification models that address this
  problem in relation to both numerical and categorical features, based on which the
  best results achieved was F1-score of 63%.
