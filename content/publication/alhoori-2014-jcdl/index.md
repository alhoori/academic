abstract: 'Changes are occurring in scholarly communication as scientific discourse
  and research activities spread across various social media platforms. In this paper,
  we study altmetrics on the article and journal levels, investigating whether the
  online attention received by research articles is related to scholarly impact or
  may be due to other factors. We define a new metric, Journal Social Impact (JSI),
  based on eleven data sources: CiteULike, Mendeley, F1000, blogs, Twitter, Facebook,
  mainstream news outlets, Google Plus, Pinterest, Reddit, and sites running Stack
  Exchange (Q&A). We compare JSI against diverse citation-based metrics, and find
  that JSI significantly correlates with a number of them. These findings indicate
  that online attention of scholarly articles is related to traditional journal rankings
  and favors journals with a longer history of scholarly impact. We also find that
  journal-level altmetrics have strong significant correlations among themselves,
  compared with the weak correlations among article-level altmetrics. Another finding
  is that Mendeley and Twitter have the highest usage and coverage of scholarly activities.
  Among individual altmetrics, we find that the readership of academic social networks
  have the highest correlations with citation-based metrics. Our findings deepen the
  overall understanding of altmetrics and can assist in validating them.'
