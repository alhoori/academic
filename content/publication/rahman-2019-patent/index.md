abstract: "A crucial goal of funding research and development has always been to advance economic development. On this basis, a considerable body of research undertaken with the purpose of determining what exactly constitutes economic impact and how to accurately measure that impact has been published. Numerous indicators have been used to measure economic impact, although no single indicator has been widely adapted. Based on patent data collected from Altmetrics we predict patent citations through various social media features using several classification models. Patents citing a research paper implies the potential it has for direct application in its field. These predictions can be utilized by researchers in determining the practical applications for their work when applying for patents."
