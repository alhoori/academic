abstract: 'Research on social-media platforms has tended to rely on textual analysis
  to perform research tasks. While text-based approaches have significantly increased
  our understanding of online behavior and social dynamics, they overlook features
  on these platforms that have grown in prominence in the past few years: click-based
  responses to content. In this paper, we present a new dataset of Facebook Reactions
  to scholarly content. We give an overview of its structure, analyze some of the
  statistical trends in the data, and use it to train and test two supervised learning
  algorithms. Our preliminary tests suggest the presence of stratification in the
  number of users following pages, divisions that seem to fall in line with distinctions
  in the subject matter of those pages.'
