abstract: The significant proliferation of scholarly output and the emergence of multidisciplinary
  research areas are rendering the research environment increasingly complex. In addition,
  an increasing number of researchers are using academic social networks to discover
  and store scholarly content. The spread of scientific discourse and research activities
  across the web, especially on social media platforms, suggests that far-reaching
  changes are taking place in scholarly communication and the geography of science.
  This dissertation provides integrated techniques and methods designed to address
  the information overload problem facing scholarly environments and to enhance the
  research process. There are four main contributions in this dissertation. First,
  this study identifies, quantifies, and analyzes international researchers’ dynamic
  scholarly information behaviors, activities, and needs, especially after the emergence
  of social media platforms. The findings based on qualitative and quantitative analysis
  report new scholarly patterns and reveals differences between researchers according
  to academic status and discipline. Second, this study mines massive scholarly datasets,
  models diverse multidimensional non-traditional web-based indicators (altmetrics),
  and evaluates and predicts scholarly and societal impact at various levels. The
  results address some of the limitations of traditional citation-based metrics and
  broaden the understanding and utilization of altmetrics. Third, this study recommends
  scholarly venues semantically related to researchers’ current interests. The results
  provide important up-to-the-minute signals that represent a closer reflection of
  research interests than post-publication usage-based metrics. Finally, this study
  develops a new scholarly framework by supporting the construction of online scholarly
  communities and bibliographies through reputation-based social collaboration, through
  the introduction of a collaborative, self-promoting system for users to advance
  their participation through analysis of the quality, timeliness and quantity of
  contributions. The framework improves the precision and quality of social reference
  management systems. By analyzing and modeling digital footprints, this dissertation
  provides a basis for tracking and documenting the impact of scholarship using new
  models that are more akin to reading breaking news than to watching a historical
  documentary made several years after the events it describes.
