abstract: New Web technologies could enhance collaboration within humanities digital
  libraries. We have investigated possible extensions to the Cervantes Project’s digital
  library that support collaboration across the collection of materials centering
  on the author of Don Quixote’s life and works. We describe the basis for our extensions,
  drawing from the experiences of users of the collection, and the implementation
  of an integrated collaborative environment that improves collaboration between users
  of the library through well-known Web 2.0 technologies. The resulting system provides
  an initial step towards building a humanities-centered Digital Community.
