abstract: "New Web technologies could enhance collaboration within humanities digital libraries. We have investigated possible extensions to the Cervantes Project’s digital library that support collaboration across the collection of materials centering on the author of Don Quixote’s life and works. We describe the basis for our extensions, drawing from the experiences of users of the collection, and the implementation of an integrated collaborative environment that improves collaboration between users of the library through well-known Web 2.0 technologies. The resulting system provides an initial step towards building a humanities-centered Digital Community."
