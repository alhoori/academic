abstract: Changes are occurring in scholarly communication and the geography of science.Policymakersand
  research funding agencies are looking for ways to measure the comprehensive impact
  of research and benefit from the research experiences of other nations. Recently,
  altmetrics have been used to measure broader impact of research activities.In this
  paper, we study altmetrics based on the country-levelimpact andfind that altmetrics
  can support research evaluation for all countries studied. We compare altmetrics
  with several traditional metrics and findsignificant relationshipsbetween country-level
  altmetrics and the number of publications, citations, h-index, and gross domestic
  expenditure on research and development (GERD). We also find a significant yearly
  increase in the number of articles published between 2010 and 2014 that received
  altmetrics.
