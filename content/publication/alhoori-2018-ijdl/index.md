abstract: As more scholarly content is born digital or converted to a digital format,
  digital libraries are becoming increasingly vital to researchers seeking to leverage
  scholarly big data for scientific discovery. Although scholarly products are available
  in abundance—especially in environments created by the advent of social networking
  services—little is known about international scholarly information needs, information-seeking
  behavior, or information use. The purpose of this paper is to address these gaps
  via an in-depth analysis of the information needs and information-seeking behavior
  of researchers, both students and faculty, at two universities, one in the USA and
  the other in Qatar. Based on this analysis, the study identifies and describes new
  behavior patterns on the part of researchers as they engage in the information-seeking
  process. The analysis reveals that the use of academic social networks has notable
  effects on various scholarly activities. Further, this study identifies differences
  between students and faculty members in regard to their use of academic social networks,
  and it identifies differences between researchers according to discipline. Although
  the researchers who participated in the present study represent a range of disciplinary
  and cultural backgrounds, the study reports a number of similarities in terms of
  the researchers’ scholarly activities.
