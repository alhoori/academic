abstract: Bibliographic digital libraries play a significant role in conducting research
  and, in the past few years, have started to move from closed to more open social
  platforms. However, in this, they have faced challenges (e.g., from Web spam) in
  maintaining the level of scholarly precision---the ratio of relevant citations retrieved
  by search. This paper describes a hybrid approach that uses online social collaboration
  and reputation based social moderation to reduce the cost and to speed up the construction
  of scholarly bibliographies that are comprehensive, have better quality citations
  and higher precision. We implemented selected social features for an established
  digital humanities project (the Cervantes Project) and compared the results with
  a number of closed and open current bibliographies. We found this can help in building
  scholarly bibliographies and significantly improve precision outcomes.
