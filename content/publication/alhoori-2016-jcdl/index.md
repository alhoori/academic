abstract: " Scholarly events and venues are increasing rapidly in number. This poses\
  \ a challenge for researchers who seek to identify events and venues related to\
  \ their work in order to draw more efficiently and comprehensively from published\
  \ research and to share their own findings more effectively. Such efforts are hampered\
  \ also by the fact that no rating system yet exists to assist researchers in culling\
  \ the venues most relevant to their current readings and interests. This study describes\
  \ a methodology we developed in response to this need, one that recommends scholarly\
  \ venues related to researchers' specific interests according to personalized social\
  \ web indicators. Our experiments applying our proposed rating and recommendation\
  \ method show that it outperforms the baseline venue recommendations in terms of\
  \ accuracy and ranking quality."
