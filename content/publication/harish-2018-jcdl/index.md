abstract: People often struggle to understand scientific texts, which leads to miscommunication
  and often to inaccurate and even sensationalistic reports of research. Identifying
  and achieving a better understanding of the factors that affect comprehension would
  be helpful to analyze what improves public understanding of science. In this study,
  we generate features from scientific text that represent some common text structures
  and use them to predict the semantic similarity between the scientific text and
  the textual content posted by the general public about the same scientific text
  online. In this endeavor, we built regression models to achieve this purpose and
  evaluated them based on their R-squared values and mean squared errors. R-squared
  values as high as 0.73 were observed, indicating a high chance of a relationship
  between certain textual features and the public's understanding of science.
