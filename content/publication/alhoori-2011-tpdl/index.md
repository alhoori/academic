abstract: "We conducted a study with an objective to learn more about the dynamic information needs, information-seeking behavior, information use and other scholarly activities of researchers. Our focus was on the collaborative and social usage and on the social reference managers. We compared the current practices and strategies of scholars and researchers from multidisciplinary research areas. Our findings provide valuable insights and augment the understanding of how the social web is having a significant effect on the current researchers' activities and digital libraries."
