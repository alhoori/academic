abstract: We conducted a study with an objective to learn more about the dynamic information
  needs, information-seeking behavior, information use and other scholarly activities
  of researchers. Our focus was on the collaborative and social usage and on the social
  reference managers. We compared the current practices and strategies of scholars
  and researchers from multidisciplinary research areas. Our findings provide valuable
  insights and augment the understanding of how the social web is having a significant
  effect on the current researchers' activities and digital libraries.
