I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Northern Illinois University and am the Director of the Data Analytics Theory and Applications (DATA) Laboratory. My research aims to advance new data-driven scientific discoveries by quantifying dynamic global research patterns and needs, mining and learning from massive unstructured scholarly datasets, modeling emerging multidimensional web indicators, recommending scholarly content pertinent to researchersâ€™ activities and interests, and predicting the societal impact of research. My current work span several new directions which include building explainable artificial intelligence models to identify reproducible research, predicting the broader impact of research, understanding public engagement with science, and developing exceptionally effective new technologies that improve the research process and leverage scientific knowledge.
