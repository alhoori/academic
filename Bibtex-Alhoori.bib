abstract ={Acid-fracturing operations are mainly applied in tight carbonate formations to create a highly conductive path. Estimating the conductivity of a hydraulic fracture is essential for predicting the fractured well productivity. Several models were developed previously to estimate the conductivity of acid-fractured rocks. In this research, machine learning methods were applied to 560 acid fracture experimental datapoints to develop several conductivity correlations that honor the rock types and etching patterns. Developing one universal correlation often results in significant error. To develop conductivity correlations, various data preprocessing methods were applied to remove the outliers and failed experiments. Features that did not contribute to precise predictions were removed through regularization. A machine learning classifier was built to predict the etching pattern based on the input data. We generated a multivariate linear regression model and compared it with other models generated through ridge regression. In addition to that, artificial neural network-based model was proposed to predict the fracture conductivity of several carbonate rocks such as dolomite, chalk, and limestone. The performance of the developed models was assessed using well-known metrics such as precision, accuracy, mean squared error, recall, and correlation coefficients. Cross-validation was also employed to assure accuracy and avoid overfitting. The classifier accuracy was 93%, while the regression model resulted in a relatively high correlation coefficient.},

abstract = {Online and in the real world, communities are bonded together by emotional consensus around core issues. Emotional responses to scientific findings often play a pivotal role in these core issues. When there is too much diversity of opinion on topics of science, emotions flare up and give rise to conflict. This conflict threatens positive outcomes for research. Emotions have the power to shape how people process new information. They can color the public's understanding of science, motivate policy positions, even change lives. And yet little work has been done to evaluate the public's emotional response to science using quantitative methods. In this paper, we use a dataset of responses to scholarly articles on Facebook to analyze the dynamics of emotional valence, intensity, and diversity. We present a novel way of weighting click-based reactions that increases their comprehensibility, and use these weighted reactions to develop new metrics of aggregate emotional responses. We use our metrics along with LDA topic models and statistical testing to investigate how users' emotional responses differ from one scientific topic to another. We find that research articles related to gender, genetics, or agricultural/environmental sciences elicit significantly different emotional responses from users than other research topics. We also find that there is generally a positive response to scientific research on Facebook, and that articles generating a positive emotional response are more likely to be widely shared---a conclusion that contradicts previous studies of other social media platforms. },

Social media platforms present multiple opportunities to mine information about behaviors pertaining to both illicit and pharmaceutical drugs and likewise to legal prescription drugs sold without a prescription, i.e., illegally. Recognized as a public health risk, the sale and use of illegal drugs, counterfeit versions of legal drugs, and legal drugs sold without a prescription constitute a widespread problem that is reflected in and facilitated by social media. Twitter provides a crucial resource for monitoring legal and illegal drug sales in order to support the larger goal of finding ways to protect patient safety. We collected our dataset using Arabic keywords. We then categorized the data using four machine learning classifiers. Based on a comparison of the respective results, we assessed the accuracy of each classifier in predicting two important considerations in analysing the extent to which drugs are available on social media: references to drugs for sale and the legality/illegality of the drugs thus advertised. For predicting tweets selling drugs, Support Vector Machine, yielded the highest accuracy rate (96%), whereas for predicting the legality of the advertised drugs, the Naive Bayes, classifier yielded the highest accuracy rate (85%)."

The purpose of this paper is to address these gaps via an in-depth analysis of the information needs and information-seeking behavior of researchers, both students and faculty, at two universities, one in the USA and the other in Qatar. Based on this analysis, the study identifies and describes new behavior patterns on the part of researchers as they engage in the information-seeking process. The analysis reveals that the use of academic social networks has notable effects on various scholarly activities. Further, this study identifies differences between students and faculty members in regard to their use of academic social networks, and it identifies differences between researchers according to discipline. Although the researchers who participated in the present study represent a range of disciplinary and cultural backgrounds, the study reports a number of similarities in terms of the researchers’ scholarly activities.},

In this study, we present a system to recommend scholarly venues rated in terms of relevance to a given researcher’s current scholarly pursuits and interests. We collected our data from an academic social network and modeled researchers’ scholarly reading behavior in order to propose a new and adaptive implicit rating technique for venues. We present a way to recommend relevant, specialized scholarly venues using these implicit ratings that can provide quick results, even for new researchers without a publication history and for emerging scholarly venues that do not yet have an impact factor. We performed a large-scale experiment with real data to evaluate the current scholarly recommendation system and showed that our proposed system achieves better results than the baseline. The results provide important up-to-the-minute signals that compared with post-publication usage-based metrics represent a closer reflection of a researcher’s interests."

	abstract = {The successful design of an acid fracture job requires accurate prediction of fractured well productivity. Productivity estimation demands knowledge of both the acid penetration length and conductivity distribution for the given reservoir. The literature includes several models developed to predict the conductivity of acid fractured rock. The most popular is empirical and based on measuring the conductivity of 25 acid fracture experiments. The present research provides empirical models utilizing machine learning techniques and incorporating 97 experiments and 563 datapoints. We conducted an extensive literature review to collect the published data on acid fracture experiments. The objective of such experiments is to measure conductivity at different formation closure stresses while considering field conditions. We used several data preprocessing techniques to clean the data, fill in missing values, exclude outliers and failed experiments, and standardize the dataset. Regularization was employed to eliminate features that didn't contribute to accurate prediction. Feature engineering was used to construct new features from our dataset. We began by measuring the correlations between features to better understand the data. We then built various machine learning models to predict acid fracture conductivity. It has been observed that developing one universal empirical correlation often results in significant errors in conductivity estimation because different rock types result in different etching patterns that cannot be explained by a single correlation. For instance, the channeling etching pattern is mostly observed in limestone formations, while a roughness pattern is seen in dolomite and chalk rock. Moreover, the conductivities of etching patterns formed in chalk, dolomite, and limestone formations behave differently. We built machine learning classification techniques to determine the most likely etching patterns (e.g., channeling, roughness). A linear regression-based model was then developed as a baseline for comparison with other models generated through ridge regression. We evaluated the performances of our models using well-known metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, mean squared error, and correlation coefficients. We also employed cross-validation to avoid over-fitting, finding that certain features were the most important in predicting acid fracture conductivity. Detailed empirical conductivity correlations and models were developed in this work for three carbonate rock types. Previously, a single empirical model has often been employed to estimate acid fracture conductivity or, at best, a model has been developed for a particular rock type. Most models have not considered the impact of etching patterns on conductivity, which was found to be significant in limestone.},

In this paper, we study altmetrics on the article and journal levels, investigating whether the online attention received by research articles is related to scholarly impact or may be due to other factors. We define a new metric, Journal Social Impact (JSI), based on eleven data sources: CiteULike, Mendeley, F1000, blogs, Twitter, Facebook, mainstream news outlets, Google Plus, Pinterest, Reddit, and sites running Stack Exchange (Q&A). We compare JSI against diverse citation-based metrics, and find that JSI significantly correlates with a number of them. These findings indicate that online attention of scholarly articles is related to traditional journal rankings and favors journals with a longer history of scholarly impact. We also find that journal-level altmetrics have strong significant correlations among themselves, compared with the weak correlations among article-level altmetrics. Another finding is that Mendeley and Twitter have the highest usage and coverage of scholarly activities. Among individual altmetrics, we find that the readership of academic social networks have the highest correlations with citation-based metrics. Our findings deepen the overall understanding of altmetrics and can assist in validating them.},

We compare altmetrics with several traditional metrics and findsignificant relationshipsbetween country-level altmetrics and the number of publications, citations, h-index, and gross domestic expenditure on research and development (GERD). We also find a significant yearly increase in the number of articles published between 2010 and 2014 that received altmetrics.",

Ranking these new venues is imperative to assist researchers, librarians, and research institutions. However, rankings based on traditional citation-based metrics have limitations and are no longer the only or the best choice to determine the impact of scholarly venues. Here, we propose a venue-ranking approach based on scholarly references from academic social media sites, and we compare a number of citation-based rankings with social-based rankings. Our preliminary results show a statistically significant correlation between the two approaches in a number of general rankings, research areas, and subdisciplines. Furthermore, we found that social-based rankings favor open-access venues over venues that require a subscription.",

However, in this, they have faced challenges (e.g., from Web spam) in maintaining the level of scholarly precision---the ratio of relevant citations retrieved by search. This paper describes a hybrid approach that uses online social collaboration and reputation based social moderation to reduce the cost and to speed up the construction of scholarly bibliographies that are comprehensive, have better quality citations and higher precision. We implemented selected social features for an established digital humanities project (the Cervantes Project) and compared the results with a number of closed and open current bibliographies. We found this can help in building scholarly bibliographies and significantly improve precision outcomes.",

abstract = {The significant proliferation of scholarly output and the emergence of multidisciplinary research areas are rendering the research environment increasingly complex. In addition, an increasing number of researchers are using academic social networks to discover and store scholarly content. The spread of scientific discourse and research activities across the web, especially on social media platforms, suggests that far-reaching changes are taking place in scholarly communication and the geography of science. This dissertation provides integrated techniques and methods designed to address the information overload problem facing scholarly environments and to enhance the research process. There are four main contributions in this dissertation. First, this study identifies, quantifies, and analyzes international researchers’ dynamic scholarly information behaviors, activities, and needs, especially after the emergence of social media platforms. The findings based on qualitative and quantitative analysis report new scholarly patterns and reveals differences between researchers according to academic status and discipline. Second, this study mines massive scholarly datasets, models diverse multidimensional non-traditional web-based indicators (altmetrics), and evaluates and predicts scholarly and societal impact at various levels. The results address some of the limitations of traditional citation-based metrics and broaden the understanding and utilization of altmetrics. Third, this study recommends scholarly venues semantically related to researchers’ current interests. The results provide important up-to-the-minute signals that represent a closer reflection of research interests than post-publication usage-based metrics. Finally, this study develops a new scholarly framework by supporting the construction of online scholarly communities and bibliographies through reputation-based social collaboration, through the introduction of a collaborative, self-promoting system for users to advance their participation through analysis of the quality, timeliness and quantity of contributions. The framework improves the precision and quality of social reference management systems. By analyzing and modeling digital footprints, this dissertation provides a basis for tracking and documenting the impact of scholarship using new models that are more akin to reading breaking news than to watching a historical documentary made several years after the events it describes.}
